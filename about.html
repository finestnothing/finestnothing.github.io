            <p id="name">About Me</p>
            <p class="about-text">
                I graduated from California State University: Sacramento with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics.
                While working towards my degree, I took as many data science and machine learning courses as were offered.
                These allowed me to greatly diversify my skills and projects, while also greatly enjoying the process of learning them.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                I am always striving to learn new things.
                Whether it's creating this website from scratch, creating a kubernetes cluster on raspberry pi's for self-hosting applications, learning stenography and photography, or any of my other hobbies, I am always driven by my passion for learning and the unknown.
                My hardest decision when entering college wasn't where to go or what to study to make the most money.
                My hardest decision was finding a path that would give me the most opportunities to learn new things both during and after college.
                I am very happy with my path of Computer Science and Mathematics, and I look forward to a long career of learning even more.
